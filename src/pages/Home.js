          <h2>What is DoDate?</h2>
          <p>DoDate is a homework tracking web application that focuses not on the date the assignment is due, but on the date the user would like to “do” it. This helps students focus not just on what is due in the future, but organize their work by when they would like to get it done and break the bigger projects into smaller, manageable pieces.</p>

          <h2>Why DoDate?</h2>
          <p>One of the main struggles students have with school is having a reliable system for tracking homework. All of the apps that are currently available only organize the assignments and projects by when they are “due”. Students can get quickly overwhelmed, and unable to proceed with what they wanted to get done. I figured out a system that would work in a planner that would organize the assignments not by when they were “due”, but by when I wanted to “do” them. I would break larger projects into smaller pieces, and spread them throughout the week. I have always loved keeping track of things I needed to do on my computer, but I wasn’t able to find a way to track my work in this fashion, without using calendar software. I found a way to implement this method in a physical planner that had each day vertical, and it has worked well so far!</p>
