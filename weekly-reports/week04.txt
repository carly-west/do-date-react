Project Title: DoDate

Team Members: Myself!

Overall Status: On-schedule

Number of hours worked since last update: 4
Number of hours worked on the project thus far: 92
Total number of hours anticipated for completion: 126

Accomplishments:
1. I got my website hosting on Github pages

Challenges:
So many challenges this week... I wasn't able to build my project because of a small issue with the way I was importing firestore into my app, and it took a long time to figure it out. I also found out that Github pages doesn't support single page applications, so I will need to find a workaround for that. Right now when I navigate to another page and refresh, it just shows the Github error page.

Plans / Goals for next week:
Figure out how to allow single page app with Github pages.

Accountability plan: (What is your plan to keep yourself honest and follow through with the goals that you have outlined?)
I will continue to keep track of the hours that I spend on the website, and track my accomplishments.
